- 1 page heading and 3 sections (in a row for desktop)
	- refer to media queries to properly
	adjust to each window size.
- Layout (DESKTOP): 
	- In the desktop view (992px and above), each of the 3 sections should take up equal amount of space on the screen. 
	- As you make the browser window wider or narrower, each section should become wider or narrower. (_Hint: use percentages to define width and use the 'float' property. See Lecture 24_). 
	- For a visual reference of this view, see the desktop mockup illustration below.
- Layout (TABLET):
	- The first 2 sections should be in the first row and be of equal size. 
	- The 3rd section should be in the second row and take up the entire row by itself. 
	- For a visual reference of this view, see the tablet mockup illustration below.
- Layout (MOBILE): 
	- Each section should take up the entire row. 
	- For a visual reference of this view, see the mobile mockup illustration below.
- Section title region: 
	- Each section should have a section title region that is always positioned at the top right corner of the section no matter the view (desktop, tablet or mobile). 
	- Copy the titles from the mockup illustration (i.e., Chicken, Beef, Sushi) or come up with your own. (_Hint: use relative and absolute positioning and offsets as discussed in Lecture 22._)
- Spacing: 
	- Pay attention to the spacing shown in the mockup illustrations. 
		- Note the spacing between sections (both horizontal and vertical). 
		- Note the horizontal spacing between the edges of the section and the edges of the browser window. 
		- Note the spacing between the dummy text in each section and the edges of the section. 
		- Make sure the dummy text is "pushed down" enough so it doesn't overlap the section title region. (_Hint: use margins and padding and use border-box as your box-sizing as discussed in Lecture 19._)
Borders and Colors: 
	- Each section should have a background color set to some color (of your choosing). 
	- Set the background color of each section title region to some unique color (of your choosing). 
	- Make sure that the background color still allows the user to view the text in the section and section title regions. Depending on the color you choose, you may want to change the color of the text so it can be easy to read.
	- Set a black border on both the section and section title region that is 1px thick.
